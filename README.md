# Data Science Job Market Analysis

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook project aims to clean, explore, and analyze a dataset containing information about data science job postings from Glassdoor. The dataset encompasses various industries, job titles, estimated salaries, company sizes, revenue, locations, and other relevant factors. The primary goal is to gain insights into the job market for data science roles and provide valuable information for job seekers, companies, and policymakers.


## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Glassdoor, a leading platform for job seekers and employers. It includes information about data science job postings, such as industry, job title, salary estimates, company size, revenue, location, and more. You can access the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor?select=Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv).

## Hypothesis

Based on the provided dataset, we hypothesize that certain industries or sectors will exhibit a higher demand for data science roles compared to others. We anticipate that industries such as technology, finance, and healthcare may demonstrate a greater need for data science expertise. Additionally, we expect to observe common job titles such as data scientist, data analyst, and data engineer among the most sought-after positions. Furthermore, we predict that there will be a correlation between company size, revenue, and salary estimation, with larger companies and higher revenue organizations likely offering higher salary ranges for data science roles. Lastly, we anticipate that certain geographic regions, such as tech hubs like Silicon Valley or major metropolitan areas, will have a higher prevalence of open data science positions compared to others.


## Research questions

This project aims to answer the following questions through data analysis:

1. Are there certain industries or sectors with high demand for data science roles, and what are the most common job titles required?
2. Do company size and revenue levels influence salary estimations among the companies in the dataset?
3. Are there geographic regions where the open positions are more prevalent?

## Findings

### High Demand Industries and Job Titles:
- The analysis indicates that industries such as 'Computer Hardware & Software', 'Enterprise Software & Network Solutions', and 'Consulting' have a high demand for data science roles.
- The most common job titles required include 'Data Scientist', 'Data Analyst', and 'Data Engineer', with staffing and outsourcing firms exhibiting the highest demand for data scientists.

### Impact of Company Size and Revenue on Salary Estimations:
- The distribution of salaries reveals that the range of 75-145K is the most prevalent, indicating significant demand within this range across different revenue categories.
- Salary ranges at the extremes, such as 30-56K and 210-335K, show limited demand, possibly influenced by budget constraints or other factors.
- While there may be some influence between salary and revenue, both factors should be considered independently when evaluating job market trends.

### Prevalence of Open Positions in Geographic Regions:
- Major cities like San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, and Boston, MA, emerge as prominent centers for open positions, with high concentrations of companies and headquarters.
- While certain locations have a higher concentration of companies, variations in the distribution of headquarters indicate diverse organizational structures and strategic decisions.
